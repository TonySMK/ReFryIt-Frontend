# ReFryIt - Front-End

The entire application suite consists of a front-end application,
back-end application, and a chrome extension application.
The project's concept attempts to provide an alternative take on native
browser bookmark managers, by providing users greater context of their "bookmarks".
As the number of bookmarks increase and as time pass, the significance and context of
each bookmark is lost amoung the sea of folders and other bookmarks. By displaying a user
defined text snippet of a "bookmarked" webpage, each "bookmark"'s' context
and exact significance can be better presented and preserved.

The chrome extension is what allows users to capture snapshots of
a webpage's texts, which are then send and stored in the back-end database.
The front-end application allows users to reveiw and modify their list of bookmarks
and reference the webpage that they captured it from via the chrome extension.
